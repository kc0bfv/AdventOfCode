Supply a filename for parameter 1 (the input formulas), supply a fuel output amount for parameter 2.  For part 2 the program will tell you how much ore is required to produce that amount of fuel.  So, then try different values for fuel outputs until your required ore "GOT IT" (gets to 1 tril).  Then back off until you "NOT YET".  Then hone the number until you find the edge, and take the closest fuel input to the edge that is still "NOT YET".  Take the not yet edge because you will have enough ore to produce that amount of fuel - you won't have quite enough ore to produce the "GOT IT" edge worth of fuel.
